# School Contest Portal API

This document describes the HTTP API provided by the NestJS backend in this repository, based on the current implementation and e2e tests.

- Base URL: `http://localhost:<PORT>` (default `http://localhost:3000`)
- Static uploads: `GET /uploads/**`

> Notes  
> - Responses are JSON unless otherwise specified.  
> - All timestamps are ISO 8601 strings in UTC (stored in the database as `DateTime`).  
> - The server uses NestJS `ValidationPipe` (`transform: true`, `whitelist: true`) and a global HTTP exception filter.

---

## Global behaviour

### Validation

The application uses NestJS `ValidationPipe` globally with:

- `transform: true` – converts payload values to DTO property types when possible (for example, `"3"` → `3` for numeric fields).
- `whitelist: true` – strips properties that are not defined in DTOs.

If validation fails, the API returns `400 Bad Request` with a structured error body (see below).

### Error responses

All uncaught HTTP errors are transformed by `HttpExceptionFilter` into a standard JSON shape:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Error message or object",
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Notes:

- `statusCode` is the HTTP status code.
- `message` may be a string or, for validation errors, an array/object provided by NestJS/class-validator.
- `error` is present for typical HTTP exceptions (for example `"Bad Request"`, `"Unauthorized"`, `"Not Found"`).
- `timestamp` is always included.

### Rate limiting

The application uses `@nestjs/throttler` with a global guard:

- Default limit: **10 requests per 60 seconds per client** (IP-based by default).

Additionally, the `POST /submissions` endpoint has a stricter route-level limit:

- Custom limit: **5 requests per 60 seconds per client**.

When the limit is exceeded, the server returns:

- Status: `429 Too Many Requests`
- Body (example):

```json
{
  "statusCode": 429,
  "message": "Too Many Requests",
  "error": "Too Many Requests",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### CORS

Global CORS configuration:

- Allowed origin: `http://localhost:5173`
- `credentials: true`

---

## Root endpoint

### GET /

- Method: `GET`
- Path: `/`
- Auth: none

Returns a simple string to verify the service is running.

#### Successful response (200)

```json
"Hello World!"
```

---

## Authentication

Administrator-only endpoints use **JWT bearer tokens**. Tokens are issued by the login endpoint and must be sent in the `Authorization` header.

### Login

- Method: `POST`
- Path: `/auth/login`
- Auth: none
- Content-Type: `application/json`

#### Request body

```json
{
  "password": "string"
}
```

The password is compared against the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable. If it does not match or `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is not set, the API returns:

- Status: `401 Unauthorized`
- Body:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 401,
  "message": "Invalid credentials",
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

#### Successful response (200)

```json
{
  "access_token": "string"
}
```

Use the returned token in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

The token:

- Has payload `{ "role": "admin" }`.
- Is signed with `JWT_SECRET`.
- Expires in 1 day.

---

## Submissions

All submission-related endpoints live under the `/submissions` path and operate on the `Submission` model.

### Submission data model

Database model (Prisma):

```ts
type Category = 'PROGRAMMING' | 'AIGC';

type Submission = {
  id: string;            // UUID
  studentName: string;
  grade: number;         // 1 - 6
  classNumber: number;   // >= 1
  category: Category;
  workTitle: string;
  fileName: string;      // original file name
  storedFileName: string;
  fileType: string;      // MIME type reported by the upload
  fileSize: number;      // in bytes
  submittedAt: string;   // ISO timestamp
};
```

### Create submission

- Method: `POST`
- Path: `/submissions`
- Auth: none
- Rate limit: 5 requests per 60 seconds per client
- Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`

This endpoint accepts a form with metadata fields plus a file upload.

#### Form fields

| Field         | Type    | Required | Description                                                      |
| ------------- | ------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `studentName` | string  | yes      | Student name, 2 to 10 characters.                               |
| `grade`       | number  | yes      | Grade, integer between 1 and 6.                                 |
| `classNumber` | number  | yes      | Class number, integer >= 1.                                     |
| `category`    | string  | yes      | One of `PROGRAMMING` or `AIGC`.                                 |
| `workTitle`   | string  | yes      | Work title, 1 to 50 characters.                                 |
| `file`        | file    | yes      | Uploaded file, validated by category and size (see below).      |

Validation rules are enforced by DTOs and the upload pipeline. Invalid fields result in `400 Bad Request` with a JSON error body as described in *Error responses*.

#### File requirements

- Field name: `file`
- Maximum size: **50 MB**
- For `category = PROGRAMMING`:
  - Allowed extensions: `.sb3`, `.mp`
  - File content must be a ZIP container (header bytes `0x50 0x4b`).
- For `category = AIGC`:
  - Allowed extensions and signatures:
    - PNG: extension `.png` and standard PNG header
    - JPEG: extension `.jpg` or `.jpeg` and standard JPEG header

The server reads the first few bytes of the uploaded file to verify its **magic bytes** and prevent disguised executables (for example, `.sb3` that is not actually a ZIP).

If the category/file combination is invalid, or if the file is missing, the endpoint returns `400 Bad Request` with a message explaining what is wrong, for example:

- Missing file:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "File is required",
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

- Unsupported file type:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Unsupported file type for the given category",
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

If the uploaded file is empty, or the `category` is not one of the supported values, the server also returns `400 Bad Request` with an appropriate message (`"Uploaded file is empty"` or `"Unsupported submission category"`).

In all failure cases that occur after the file is written to disk, the server attempts to delete the file from the `uploads` directory.

#### Successful response (201)

On success the endpoint creates a `Submission` record and returns it as JSON:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "studentName": "Alice",
  "grade": 3,
  "classNumber": 2,
  "category": "PROGRAMMING",
  "workTitle": "My Project",
  "fileName": "project.sb3",
  "storedFileName": "a5c9fc2e-4d53-4a9f-9e3c-2b4c73dfc1b2.sb3",
  "fileType": "application/zip",
  "fileSize": 123456,
  "submittedAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### List all submissions

- Method: `GET`
- Path: `/submissions`
- Auth: required (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`)

Returns **all** submissions ordered by `submittedAt` in descending order (most recent first).

#### Successful response (200)

```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "studentName": "Alice",
    "grade": 3,
    "classNumber": 2,
    "category": "PROGRAMMING",
    "workTitle": "My Project",
    "fileName": "project.sb3",
    "storedFileName": "a5c9fc2e-4d53-4a9f-9e3c-2b4c73dfc1b2.sb3",
    "fileType": "application/zip",
    "fileSize": 123456,
    "submittedAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

If the JWT is missing or invalid, the endpoint returns `401 Unauthorized` with the standard error shape.

### List final submission per student and category

- Method: `GET`
- Path: `/submissions/final`
- Auth: required (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`)

Returns, for each unique combination of:

- `grade`
- `classNumber`
- `studentName`
- `category`

only the **latest submission** (by `submittedAt`). The response shape is the same as for `GET /submissions` (an array of `Submission` objects).

> Implementation note: this is implemented using a query that selects distinct combinations of the fields above, ordered by `submittedAt` descending, so each group yields its most recent record.

### Download submission file

- Method: `GET`
- Path: `/submissions/:id/download`
- Auth: required (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`)

Downloads the file associated with a submission.

#### Path parameters

| Name | Type   | Description                  |
| ---- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| `id` | string | Submission ID (UUID format). |

#### Behaviour

1. Looks up the submission record by ID.
2. Resolves the file from the `uploads` directory using `storedFileName`.
3. If the record is missing, returns `404 Not Found` with:

   ```json
   {
     "statusCode": 404,
     "message": "Submission not found",
     "error": "Not Found",
     "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
   }
   ```

4. If the record exists but the file is missing on disk, returns `404 Not Found` with:

   ```json
   {
     "statusCode": 404,
     "message": "File not found",
     "error": "Not Found",
     "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
   }
   ```

5. On success, streams the file content back to the client.
6. Sets the `Content-Type` header to the stored `fileType` (or `application/octet-stream` if unset).
7. Sets the `Content-Disposition` header to suggest a meaningful download name based on grade, class number and student name, preserving the original extension when possible, for example:

   ```http
   Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="3-2-Alice.sb3"
   ```

### Check daily submission quota

- Method: `GET`
- Path: `/submissions/check`
- Auth: none

Checks whether the given student is allowed to submit a new work **today**.

#### Query parameters

| Name          | Type   | Required | Description                         |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `studentName` | string | yes      | Student name to check for the day.  |

If `studentName` is missing, the endpoint returns:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "studentName is required",
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

#### Successful response (200)

```json
{
  "canSubmit": true
}
```

The value is `false` when at least one submission by the same `studentName` already exists **between the start of today and the start of tomorrow** (inclusive of start, exclusive of end) in the server's local timezone.

Example when a submission already exists today:

```json
{
  "canSubmit": false
}
```

## Static uploads

In addition to the controlled download endpoint, the server exposes the `uploads` directory as static files:

- Method: `GET`
- Path: `/uploads/**`
- Auth: none

This is configured via `ServeStaticModule` and serves whatever files are present in the `uploads` directory. When accessing files directly through this path:

- File names are the on-disk `storedFileName` values (for example `a5c9fc2e-4d53-4a9f-9e3c-2b4c73dfc1b2.sb3`), not the friendly names used by the download endpoint.
- HTTP response headers (such as `Content-Type`) are determined by the underlying static file middleware.

---

## Environment variables

The application relies on the following environment variables:

| Name             | Required | Description                                              |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`           | no       | HTTP port to listen on (default `3000`).                |
| `DATABASE_URL`   | yes      | PostgreSQL connection string used by Prisma.            |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | yes      | Password required by `POST /auth/login`.                |
| `JWT_SECRET`     | yes      | Secret key for signing and verifying JWT tokens.        |

Ensure these variables are set correctly before starting the application.
